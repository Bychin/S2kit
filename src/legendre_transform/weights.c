/**
 * @file weights.c
 * @brief Contains the function that generates the weights for a Legendre transform.
 *
 * Basically, it contains the implementation of the formula as defined in the tensor paper,
 * and also given in the so(3) paper and is mentioned in the s^2 paper! // TODO find these pages
 *
 * This formula is slightly different from the one given in the original Driscoll and Healy paper
 * because they were sampling at the poles, and now we're not.
 *
 * In pseudo-TeX, the formula for the bandwidth B weights is:
 * @code
 * w_B(j) = 2/B sin((pi*(2j+1))/(4B)) *
 *     sum_{k=0}^{B-1} 1/(2k+1)*sin((2j+1)(2k+1)pi/(4B))
 * where j = 0, 1, ..., 2 B - 1 @endcode
